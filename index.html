    <h1>Journey</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Sometimes it is better to <i>begin the journey</i>, to get under way, <br>then it is to sit back and wait until such time that you're convinced that all conditions are perfect and that there'll be no surprises along the route. <b>John Engler</b></p>

    <p><em>journey, after all, neither begins in the instant we set out, nor ends when we have reached our door step once again. <br> It starts much earlier and is really never over, because the film of memory continues running on inside of us long after we have come to a physical standstill. <br> Indeed, there exists something like a contagion of travel, and the disease is essentially incurable.</em></p>
